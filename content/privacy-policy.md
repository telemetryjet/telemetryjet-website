TelemetryJet, Inc. operates the website [telemetryjet.com](https://telemetryjet.com/) – henceforth referred to as "TelemetryJet". It is TelemetryJet’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, TelemetryJet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TelemetryJet’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TelemetryJet’s visitors use its website. From time to time, TelemetryJet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. TelemetryJet also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information


Certain visitors to TelemetryJet’s websites choose to interact with TelemetryJet in ways that require TelemetryJet to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TelemetryJet gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with TelemetryJet are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, TelemetryJet collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with TelemetryJet. TelemetryJet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

TelemetryJet may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, TelemetryJet may monitor the most popular links or screen behavior to help identify spam. TelemetryJet may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, TelemetryJet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

TelemetryJet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TelemetryJet’s behalf or to provide services available at TelemetryJet’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TelemetryJet’s website and services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TelemetryJet will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TelemetryJet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when TelemetryJet believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TelemetryJet, third parties or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of an TelemetryJet website and have supplied your email address, TelemetryJet may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with TelemetryJet and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. TelemetryJet takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. TelemetryJet uses cookies to help TelemetryJet identify and track visitors, their usage of TelemetryJet website, and their website access preferences. TelemetryJet visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using TelemetryJet’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of TelemetryJet’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If TelemetryJet, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that TelemetryJet goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of TelemetryJet may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, TelemetryJet may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in TelemetryJet’s sole discretion. TelemetryJet encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
