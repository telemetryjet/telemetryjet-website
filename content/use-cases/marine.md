## Overview
Experimental solar electric boats are complicated systemsthat 

A robust, easy to use 

In this case study, we'll look at the use of TelemetryJet to analyze performance data from the University of Rochester's solar boat team during the 2019 Solar Splash competition.

Solar Splash is a competition held among college engineering teams. Teams spend the year developing and optimizing solar boats.
