## Our Goal
We are building software that empowers teams to gain insight from their data. TelemetryJet was born out of a frustration: Collecting and sharing data on small engineering teams involves manual work that distracts from the core goal of using that data. TelemetryJet provides a no-code platform for data collection, analysis, and sharing, allowing your team to focus on utilizing your data to reach your objectives.

Our aim is to innovate in three areas:

- **Data Collection**:  Empower teams to easily collect data from their systems, no code required. Provide integrations for popular platforms, and powerful APIs that make it easy to connect custom data sources. Seamlessly combine data from multiple data sources into a consistent time-series database. 

- **Data Analysis**: Provide powerful tools to visualize and analyze data. Promote the creation of visualizations that are accurate, easy to interpret, and beautiful. Maintain performance even when analyzing large datasets, through intelligent streaming and filtering of data.

- **Data Sharing**: Enable collaboration by building sharing into the platform: Teams should be able to share their data, visualizations, and dashboards instantly with anyone. Allow easy export of data from the TelemetryJet platform into standard formats when more advanced analysis is needed.

## Open Source Philosophy

All projects in the TelemetryJet ecosystem are open-sourced: Teams are free to modify or self-host the tool as needed. We accept contributions and feature requests on our public [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/telemetryjet).

The TelemetryJet Server is offered under a dual-license AGPLv3 and commercial license. Under the AGPLv3 license, you are free to distribute, modify, and re-use TelemetryJet provided you honor the terms of the license, requiring derivative works to be published under the same license. In addition, we offer commercial licenses to organizations that want to use or redistribute Telemetryjet under proprietary terms.

This hybrid licensing scheme allows TelemetryJet to be supported by its commercial usage, while also preserving the ability to fully open-source the software.

## Project History
The concept for TelemetryJet was influenced by our teamâ€™s work on the University of Rochester solar boat racing team. Our solar boat team took a data-first design approach which involved collecting extensive data on the performance of the boat, quantitatively analyzing the performance of drivetrain systems.

As we collected data, we recognized a core issue: Analyzing, visualizing, and sharing our data involved a large amount of manual work that distracted from our goals. Time that our team could have spent utilizing the insights to improve our systems was instead spent processing data -- And sharing between collaborators was a similarly technical process.

TelemetryJet is the solution: A seamless, no-code approach to data analysis with sharing built into the platform from the start.
